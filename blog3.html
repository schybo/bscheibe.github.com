					<h1 class="blog-title"> Reno 911 </h1>
					<h3 class="blog-date"> Date: Tuesday December 18th </h3>
					<p class="blog-text"> Over the next few weeks I'll be revamping the site's UI. You may be thinking that because the site's background changed and the colour scheme on the container boxes has altered slightly that I'll just be adding a few things here and there in the revamp. However I changed the colour scheme because it just didn't work. How many site's do you see with one of their main colours being orange. Basically zero. There's a reason for that. Which is why I changed it during the renovations. For the renoâ€™s I'll be completely starting the CSS from scratch for the site, hoping to give it a harder edged look. This design I'm running at the moment is great, but was always planned as a stepping-stone. </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> When starting the site I drew inspiration from my brother's site, well maybe a little more than inspiration. I thought the design was sleek and sexy, and having his github source code folders was an added bonus. You may be thinking here, wait did you just copy your brother's design? I could have. He had the Creative Commons copyright up which allowed me to manipulate his design in any way I felt necessary. But I didn't. I never once copy pasted. I used his work as an outline of my own. I believe that everybody should do the same. </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> When first starting a website it's a little daunting. You may have learned some HTML and CSS along the way but the best you might remember is how to print "Hello, World" up on your local browser. This is why I recommend that everybody who wants to create a site do the following. Find a site whose design matches the idea of what your site looks like and attempt to use their design as an outline for your own. If your lucky you may find a website that has a link to their source CSS. When I did this with my brother's site, for every one line I used as base material, I remembered another ten CSS elements that I used a few years ago. It jump-started my memory, and after a few lines of viewing my brother's code I no longer needed it. The same might go for you, and even if you don't know much HTML or CSS it's probably the best way to learn the language and syntax. On a side not I've written half a guide to getting your site up online, and should be released with a few days, so stay tuned. </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> No here's the key point. I 'leapfrogged' off my brother's idea. I used his basic outline but then added a few of my own touches, such as the buttons. I never really encapsulated his design so would never been able to make the design better (the point of leapfrogging), but I was able to differentiate from his design slightly. I could do this because of his Creative Commons copyright license. However most of the time you wouldn't be able to do this because of copyright protection on many sites. Don't get me wrong though, you should still use a site for an outline, the chance of any issue arrising would be pretty slim. I'm however trying to get to the heart of the matter, copyright protection itself. Countless legal battles, such as the one between Samsung and Apple, are being fought over copyright infringement this, copyright infringement that. Companies have entire legal teams just for the process of finding businesses they can exploit and sue for copyright infringement. It's a way of turning up revenue for some companies. But I don't really give a damn about how corporations make their money. I do give a damn about how this limits our ability to 'create' at a very basic level.</p>
					<p class="blog-text"> I once did a report in my senior high school regarding the Gutenberg press. One of my points I hit on was how scientists and mathematicians were now able to create scientific journals easily after the release of the press and then send them off to academics across the globe. At the same time as this occured the number of new discoveries in academic fields soared. The conclusion? These scientists were now able to collaborate with each other. They would read these journals and leapfrog of these ideas to new thoughts and ideas that they would never have found without the help of these journals. Copyright infringement is the exact opposite of these journals; it's a detriment to creativity and new ideas. </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> Now don't get me wrong, I realize there has to be some way to control your creations and ensure you get the credit you deserve. But I think that people might want to look at the bigger picture before always calling their lawyer. Instead of Apple suing Samsung for copyright infringement, suppose they used the payroll of their legal team in the R&D department? Instead of getting jealous that's someone's copying you, be honoured. Instead of using your energy to sue someone, use that energy to take your product one step further. I am fully for copyright, especially if you need it to secure a salary and give you a decent living. Don't let anybody maliciously take your idea from you. But be lenient. Especially in the case of Apple, where they have enough money in the bank to keep them drinking martinis day in a day out for years. They didn't need to sue to survive. They were scared. They were jealous. Other companies were creating phones just as good as theirs. So next time your in the position to sue, just think for a second. Is this to protect my work? Or is this because I'm jealous? Scared? Greedy? </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> Not only am I worried about copyright infringement affecting our progress as a civilization. I'm worried about where the discoveries of our race our heading, and especially the prevalence of suing in society these days. However I'll write posts about these topics later. They'll be leapfrogging off this posts ideas though. That's for sure.</p>
					<p class="blog-text"> N.B. Some people may disagree with my opinions or views, which is completely fine and obviously going to happen. Therefore in the revamping of this blog I'll be adding a comment box for those who wish to add to the discussion. Contradiction, I think, leads to healthy discussion about issues and provide greater insight then mindlessly following one source (Yes, mass media news networks this is you).<br><br> Hazaar, <br> Schybo </p>
