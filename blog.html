			<p class="blogstyle"> Just a post to format the blog posting fundamentals of the site. Everything is beginning to come back to me, albiet with some style issues still be resolved among other things. But the core build is working...sorta. THe new added functionality of CSS3. I already have my real first blog post lined up to go, but having some problems with positioning. Need to remember how to use divs and padding properly back from gr.11 but should happen tomorrow. The scrolling seems to work well. But the padding on the right is dreadful. I also should remove the blue background from thisslid as it doesn't work. Maybe make the background solid too. <br><br>Hmm. Trying to continue typing to fill up to the bootom of the screen to double check. Also got to fix the space above schybo.com on this page even though it's 0px which is strange, <br>Brent Scheibelhut</p>
