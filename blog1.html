					<h3 class="blog-date"> Date: Wednesday November 12th 2012 </h3>
					<p class="blog-text">Welcome to Schybo.com, a site whose main purpose is to house the works of its producer. Yes, I refer to the site as a person, just as sailors refer to their ships with a female persona. Hopefully the two of us will have a good, healthy relationship, and probably shall, as domestic abuse on my part can only hurt my wallet. Eh, not funny, but that's why I went about creating this blog. I want an outlet where I can focus on producing high quality literature and writing. Maybe articles, maybe short stories, maybe something I've don't even have a term for. The point is that now that I'm out of high school and in a program where written English skills are virtually non-existent I'd like a place to practice and keep in touch with my ability to write. </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> Some people don't feel this way, but according to me the more you write, the better you get at it. There are some clauses here or there obviously, but just like anything else 'practice makes perfect'. It's as if I doing a new puzzle every time I write, but each time I do it I get better at putting the pieces, quicker, faster, edgier. Sort of like a Rubikâ€™s cube. But that's where the clauses come in. I don't find it helps to write about subjects which you have no interest in. There's no fire, no passion, to create a work of art. More labour is put into getting yourself writing then actually working on creating a good document. Your trying to please your reader rather than making the words flow. </p>
					<p class="blog-text">Where I find I do my best writing is when I write about my opinions. How I feel and why I feel it. I put character into the writing instead of it just being the garbled junk that is report writing. How many times do you get to express your opinion in writing? Alright a few, I'll admit, an essay can be your opinionated work. But how many times can you express your opinion in writing, with not boundaries, no limitation, no restraints. Twitter's been good with this; it's given a good outlet for people who need to express themselves. Only thing is, it seems to be more and more about making the tweeter look good or creating witty remarks then being about depth. Which is completely fine. I haven't used enough of it to generate a further opinion, and probably won't ever - it's not for me. </p>
					<p class="blog-text"> Not only opinions, sorry I've readjusted my thinking, opinionated articles I'll call them. I'm not making a blog to bitch and complain which I've probably been doing a little in the past paragraphs. I want to create opinionated articles relating to world issues. That sounds good. So then, not only opinionated articles do I want to have on this blog but also stories blended together with life to form concise pieces. Sort of what they have in the back page of the Globe Life & Arts sections (That was a good merge by the way).</p>
					<p class="blog-text">Not to mention this blog is helping me get my web developing skills back in order. A huge "bigup" has to be given to my brother Kirk for the patience he spent teaching me the basics of Git to me as well as helping get this site off the ground. But I'm trying to put a few hours into the site a day, so expect some changes to the basic layout of the site. Some days bug occur and those can take a few minutes to a few days to fix, delaying the process, but all in all, I'm going to try and continually improve this site </p>
					<p class="blog-text">N.B. Say Rise Up Lights, your saying "Razor Blades" in Australian<br>N.B. Positive Pregnancy Tests for Males indicate prostates cancer<br>N.B. Heck I may even put some stock analysis' up on this site, I miss doing those<br><br>Hazaar,<br>Schybo</p>
